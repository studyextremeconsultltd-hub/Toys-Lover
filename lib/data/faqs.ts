    group: "Shipping",
    question: "Where do you ship from, and how long does delivery take?",
    answer:
      "Orders ship from our Manchester shop in the United Kingdom. Most UK addresses receive parcels in 1–3 working days. You will receive a tracking note by email.",
  },
  {
    group: "Shipping",
    question: "Do you offer free shipping?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Standard UK shipping is free on orders over £60. Below that, a flat UK rate applies. Expedited options can be selected at checkout.",
  },
  {
    group: "Shipping",
    question: "Can I change my address after placing an order?",
    answer:
      "If the parcel has not been handed to the courier, write to hello@toybloom.example with your order number. Once it is in transit, we can help redirect only where the courier allows it.",
  },
  {
    group: "Returns",
    question: "What is your return window?",
    answer:
      "You have 14 days after delivery to start a return for unused items in original packaging. Opened toys that have been played with cannot be resold for safety reasons, except in the case of a defect.",
  },
  {
    group: "Returns",
    question: "How do I return a damaged or incorrect item?",
    answer:
      "Photograph the issue, keep the packaging, and email us within 48 hours of delivery. We will arrange a replacement or refund without asking you to pay return postage for our mistake.",
  },
  {
    group: "Safety",
    question: "How do you check toys for safety?",
    answer:
      "We only list products that meet recognised standards such as EN 71 or ASTM F963 (as applicable). Product pages list materials, age guidance, and supervision notes.",
  },
  {
    group: "Safety",
    question: "Are your materials non-toxic?",
    answer:
      "We favour food-grade silicone, organic cotton, water-based paints, and FSC wood. Each product’s Safety & materials section names what you are buying.",
  },
  {
    group: "Age",
    question: "How should I use the age ranges?",
    answer:
      "Age marks are about small parts, strength, and typical development — not a child’s intelligence. If your child is between stages, choose the more conservative option for unsupervised play.",
  },
  {
    group: "Age",
    question: "Can I buy a STEM kit for a younger child if I supervise?",
    answer:
      "Often yes. Check the product page: some kits say “10+ with an adult.” Supervision does not make tiny parts safe for toddlers.",
  },
  {
    group: "Payments",
    question: "Which payment methods do you accept?",
    answer:
      "This demo checkout is a frontend preview. A live Toy Bloom shop would typically accept major cards and Apple Pay / Google Pay. Prices are in pounds sterling. No real payment is processed here.",
  },
  {
    group: "Orders",
    question: "Can I order for pickup in Manchester?",
    answer:
      "Yes — choose local pickup at checkout and we will confirm when your bag is ready at 14 King Street Arcade. Bring the confirmation email.",

    group: "Orders",
    question: "Do you wrap gifts?",
    answer:
